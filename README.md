This is a portolio project I built using React + Redux for the Front End and Firebase + NodeJS for the Back End. 

### Front End
I built this using React's Functional Components instead of Class Components because it's my personal preference. I've used React Hooks where applicable, but primary state management is accomplished using Redux. I've also integrated Redux-Sagas as a middleware for handling side effects.

### Back End
The Back End uses Firebase's Firestore and Authentication services. I also have a server built with NodeJS + Express that handles payments through a test-mode of Stripe. This server also sets up some of the necessary environment configurations.
