This is a portolio project I built using React + Redux for the Front End and Firebase + NodeJS for the Back End. 

### Front End
I built this using React's Functional Components primarily because of preference. I've used React Hooks where applicable, but primary state management is accomplished using Redux. I've also integrated Redux-Sagas as a middleware for handling side effects.

### Back End
The Back End uses Firebase's Firestore and Authentication services. I also have a server built with NodeJS + Express that handles payments through a test-mode of Stripe. This server also sets up some of the necessary environment configurations.
